# fraud-detection
This project involves detecting fraudulent transactions using logistic regression. I preprocessed the data by handling missing values, scaling, and encoding features. Data visualization helped uncover patterns in transaction behavior. The logistic regression model was then trained and evaluated, effectively identifying potential fraud cases.

The dataset had two columns that wouldn't help the model because it was IDs.

The dataset had 0.1% of fraud transcation.

In the future, I will try downsampling techique and see the effect of it on the model as well as try other models.
