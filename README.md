# fraud-detection
This project involves detecting fraudulent transactions using logistic regression. I preprocessed the data by handling missing values, scaling, and encoding features. Data visualization helped uncover patterns in transaction behavior. The logistic regression model was then trained and evaluated, effectively identifying potential fraud cases.
